					<p><b>Nujabes</b> (real name: 瀬葉淳, Seba Jun) was a Japanese hip-hop record producer, DJ, composer and arranger, who to this day is regarded as one of the most extraordinary, influential, and revered hip-hop producers of his generation.</p>
					<p>He is famous for his mellow and atmospheric approach to hip hop, as well as his focus on the instrumental aspects of the genre. His inspirations were many, ranging from jazz artists like Miles Davis and Laurindo Almeida to hip hop producers DJ Premier and Pete Rock. Oftentimes, music that he admired would appear in his own tracks via sampling. Very little is known about Nujabes’s life outside the studio: he avoided interviews, live concerts, and other promotional activities, instead choosing to keep the public’s focus on his music, rather than the man behind the records.</p>
					<p>This page is a tribute to his life and legacy.</p>

						"Through his soulful music, Nujabes has touched so many people around the world, even beyond his dreams. He was a mysterious character to most as he avoided the public limelight, rarely conducted interviews, so only a few got to know the man behind the signature production. Yet it continued to amaze me how young listeners of all backgrounds learned of his enigmatic name, and expressed support for his music."
